# Boat-Defenders

## About:
##### Boat Defenders is the first game I decided to create outside of class.
##### My inspiration for coming up with Boat Defenders comes from *Space Invaders* and my Computer Science teacher Mr. Um, a U.S Navy Veteran.
##### Although I haven't gotten back to completing the game, I have completed an MVP.

## How to Play:
##### Use "A/D" to move the ship left and right
##### The ship's turret follows the mouse & you can press "SPACE" or "Left Click" to fire at the Aliens
##### Your goal is to survive for as long as possible while shooting down the Aliens
